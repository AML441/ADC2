                <p>Hi! I'm Amber, a freshman CS-major in the ACES Honors College.
                    <br> <br>
                   Other than App Dev Bootcamp, I'm on the Cryptocurrency Team for Justice For Fraud Victims [JFV] and am the Team Captain for ACES Honors Ambassadors! 
                   My desire to join App Dev Bootcamp stems from my love of working on technical team-based projects. Although I'm not very familiar with web development yet, I hope to use what I've learned in the bootcamp to contribute to my future projects! 
                   But beyond that, I'm a lover for exclaimation points, boba, and psychological thrillers. I love meeting new people, so don't be afraid to reach out! 
                </p>

                <h2>My Interests! </h2>
                <p> I like playing video games [Honkai Star Rail, Roblox, etc.], collect Pokemon cards/blindboxes, and reads online comics. I have a hobby of building lego versions of famous architecture! As for movies, I tend to like action/psychological thrillers the most. My favorite movies/TV shows include Parasite, Spirited Away, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Pantheon! 
                    <br> <br> Even so, I always try to keep an open-mind for new interests. From playing chess to occasionally playing badminton, I'm always down to explore!  </p>

                <h2> My Dislikes...</h2>
                <p> Of course, with every like, there exists a dislike. I HATE beans, badly-written horror movies, and overly sugary drinks. One of my biggest pet peeves is being late to something, so I tend to get to places way more earlier than I should, haha. <br> <br> I used to not like taking photos of myself, but I've been trying to take more nowadays. Even if I don't like how they turn out, I like the memories that accompany it. </p>

                <h2> My Passion!</h2>
                <p> My passion for working on team-based projects began in my Senior year of high school [just last year! Wow, time flies]. I worked with 2 of my friends to address the food insecurity within our community by developing The Seed.link. We developed prototypes, design briefs, and technical pitches to present to a panel of engineers. We ended up winning 1st Place nationally for Poster Symposium. I learned a lot about the important of collaboration, detailled planning, and risk-taking. From the inside jokes, shared struggles, and the notion of having the same goal, I had so much fun working on this project that I wanted to pursue something similar here at UMD.
